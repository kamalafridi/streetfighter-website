<p class="whitetext" >Street Fighter is one of the highest-grossing video game franchises of all time and is one of Capcom's flagship series with total sales of 46 million units worldwide as of March 2021.It is the highest-grossing fighting game media franchise of all time at $12.2 billion.</p>

<p class="whitetext">The Street Fighter series has a pretty convoluted and wide ranging story line. There are some fairly ludicrous plot arcs while others are interesting. This guide was created to highlight some of the major things in the series.</p>

<p class="whitetext">Street Fighter canon only comes from the games themselves. The animes, comic books, movies and other things have been disregarded. Although some elements from these things were adapted into the games â€” this was rarely the case.</p>
