<p class="whitetext">The Street Fighter series has a pretty convoluted and wide ranging story line. There are some fairly ludicrous plot arcs while others are interesting. This guide was created to highlight some of the major things in the series.</p>

<p class="whitetext">Street Fighter canon only comes from the games themselves. The animes, comic books, movies and other things have been disregarded. Although some elements from these things were adapted into the games â€” this was rarely the case.</p>
